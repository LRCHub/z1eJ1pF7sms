[00:19.71] The bell tower
[00:24.13] Strikes the hour
[00:28.91] On another day
[00:35.91] 
[00:37.87] But I remember
[00:42.19] Just out of nowhere
[00:47.29] Young and slender
[00:50.59] She appears from somewhere
[01:03.59] 
[00:56.22] Corduroy jacket
[01:00.23] And leather satchel
[01:05.48] Belt with brackets
[01:08.86] Pants with denim patches
[01:20.86] 
[01:32.64] I clock the minute
[01:37.70] With her in it
[01:42.09] We were thick as thieves
[01:54.09] 
[01:50.92] She's my protector
[01:55.28] Bad vibes rejector
[01:59.65] Wisecrack injector
[02:03.92] Bumblebee inspector
[02:13.42] 
[02:09.21] She's my defender
[02:13.62] For as long as I can remember
[02:18.19] Fragile and tender
[02:22.07] Small bird befriender
[02:32.57] 
[02:45.95] She's my protector
[02:49.94] Bad vibes rejector
[02:54.71] Wisecrack injector
[02:58.65] Bumblebee inspector
[03:08.15] 
[03:04.20] She's my defender
[03:08.18] For as long as I can remember
[03:12.86] Fragile and tender
[03:16.88] Small bird befriender
[03:27.38] 
[03:22.34] Those times, it just hit me
[03:26.28] They'll forever stay here with me
